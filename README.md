<h1>Description</h1>
<p align = "justify">
Developed a simple <b>user management system</b> using Java and SQL, with JDBC as the connection bridge to the SQL database. 
  This system is designed to collect user details such as ID, name, age, and city, and store them in a structured SQL database. 
  It supports essential CRUD operations, including saving new records, clearing input fields, deleting existing entries, and retrieving data. 
  This project highlights practical database interaction and efficient management of user information through an intuitive interface.
